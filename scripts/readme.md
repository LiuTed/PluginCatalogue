## Plugin disabling

Some time you need to disable some plugins during the category generating due to the plugin information is no longer valid, and here's the way to do that

Added these 2 fields in the `plugin_info.json`

```json
    "disable": true,
    "disable_reason": "(optional) why it's disable",
```

That's it, the scripts will ignore these plugins marked as disabled
